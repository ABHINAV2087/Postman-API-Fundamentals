# Client-Server Architecture Fundamentals

Following terms constitute the fundamental components of a typical client-server architecture, where the client initiates communication via APIs with the server to access and utilize various services or data.

## Client

The client is the requester in the client-server architecture. It could be a browser, web application, or mobile application. The client's primary role is to initiate requests to the server for services or data.

## API

An API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a simplified interface for interacting with the backend. It defines the methods and data formats that clients can use to communicate with the server.

## Server

The server is the backend where all the processing happens. It receives requests from the client through the API, processes them, and sends back the appropriate responses. The server handles tasks such as data storage, business logic, and computation.
